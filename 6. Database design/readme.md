#### Design principles
- When designing a database, you need to decide on the structure of the database: what tables are in the database and what columns are in each table. There are a lot of possibilities for this, but knowing a few principles will go a long way.
- A good goal in design is to make the resulting database easy to use using SQL. The database structure should be such that information can be retrieved and changed easily using SQL commands.
- Database design principles are useful and often lead to workable solutions. However, it is worth considering what the principles are behind and when it might be worth doing something different. A good goal is to create a database that is fit for purpose, not to follow the principles without your own thinking.
