#### Task 85
- Calculate how many ways two passengers can be selected who are in the same carriage.
#### Example
- Wagons
  
| id | name   | seats |
|----|--------|-------|
| 1  | wagon1 | 10    |
| 2  | wagon2 | 10    |
| 3  | wagon3 | 10    |
| 4  | wagon4 | 10    |

- Passengers
  
| id | name        | wagon_id |
|----|-------------|----------|
| 1  | Uolevi      | 1        |
| 2  | May         | 1        |
| 3  | Kaleppi     | 2        |
| 4  | Home light  | 4        |
| 5  | Justina     | 4        |
| 6  | Vihtori     | 4        |

From this data, we can see:
- **Wagon 1** has 2 passengers (Uolevi and May)
- **Wagon 2** has 1 passenger (Kaleppi) 
- **Wagon 3** has 0 passengers
- **Wagon 4** has 3 passengers (Home light, Justina, and Vihtori)

Is there something specific you'd like to know about this data, such as:
- Which wagons have available seats?
- How many passengers are in each wagon?
- Finding wagons with no passengers?
