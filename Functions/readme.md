#### Functions
- The course is completed by solving exercises. All exercises must be solved independently using the course material and other sources.
**The deadline for all course assignments is Sunday, March 8, 2026 at 11:59 PM.**
#### SQL tasks
- The SQL exercises in the course are completed in the SQL Trainer system, which has 100 exercises for practicing the SQL language. You will receive one course point for each exercise. You can resubmit your answers without restrictions, and the number of attempts does not affect your points.
- Tasks 1–20 relate to chapter 2 of the material, tasks 21–40 relate to chapter 3 of the material, and tasks 41–60 relate to chapter 4 of the material. Tasks 61–100 are more difficult tasks that combine techniques learned in the course.
I'll create a comprehensive table organizing all 100 tasks by chapter and difficulty.
