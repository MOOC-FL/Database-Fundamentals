#### Project tasks
- [ ] On this page you will find the course project assignments.
- [ ] You must solve the tasks independently, but you can use online sources and artificial intelligence tools to solve the tasks as you wish.
- [ ] For all programming tasks, you can use Python or R.
- [ ] The solutions to the tasks are returned as a single PDF report. Each task describes in more detail what needs to be returned.

Task Distribution & Grading Table

| **Task ID** | **Task Name** | **Chapter** | **Topic Area** | **Points** | **Difficulty** |
|:-----------:|:--------------|:-----------:|:---------------|:----------:|:---------------|
| 1 | Using a database | 2 | Database Basics | 30 | Basic |
| 2 | Database design | 2 | Design & Modeling | 10 | Basic |
| 3 | Transactions | 2 | Transaction Management | 10 | Basic |
| 4 | Index efficiency | 2 | Performance Tuning | 10 | Basic |
| 5 | Relational algebra | 2 | Query Theory | 10 | Basic |
| 6 | NoSQL database | 2 | Alternative Databases | 10 | Basic |
| 7 | Database conversion | 2 | Migration | 10 | Basic |
| 8 | Course conclusion | 2 | Review | 10 | Basic |
| **Total** | |  | | **100** | |


| **Chapter** | **Tasks** | **Total Points** | **Difficulty** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Chapter 2 | 1-8 | 100 | Basic |
| Chapter 3 | 21-40 | *Not listed in your input* | Basic |
| Chapter 4 | 41-60 | *Not listed in your input* | Basic |
| Combined | 61-100 | *Not listed in your input* | Advanced |

**Note:** Based on your initial mapping (Tasks 1–20 = Chapter 2), all 8 tasks listed have been assigned to **Chapter 2**.  
If these tasks actually belong to later chapters or if you provide the remaining tasks, I can update the distribution accordingly.
#### Scoring
- You can choose which tasks you solve as you wish. For example, if you solve tasks 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8, your score will be 30 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70. In task 1, you can get different scores depending on which subtasks you solve.
- Course staff will review returns after the course deadline, but your scores will not change unless you have clearly acted contrary to the instructions.
#### Return
- Please submit the assignments as a single PDF file containing all your answers.
- Include information about the sources you used at the end of your report. If you have used artificial intelligence tools, also explain how you used them.
